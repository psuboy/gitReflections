Lesson 1:

git --help  gives you a list of all your commands.

What I learned.  
there are great built in compare tools in windows and in Mac and Linux.  
For Windows FC is the tool (FC stands for File Compare)
In Mac or Linux the command is diff.  (sands for difference)
the commands are used pretty similarly .  
fc old_file new_file
diff -u old_file new_file

When to commmit:
Commit single changes.  

Copy a git repository:  Use git clone address_of_file

Tracking changes arross files

multilpe files called a repository...
can look at  some good info with the stat command.
navigate to the directory with your files.  then do:
git log --stat   
shows your your committs
q for quit gets you out of it.  
then you can do git diff with IDs you want.  
git diff old_file new_file

git Checkout
You can reset all the files to a previous commit.  It loads the version of the repository you select into the file.  
When you checkout a commit you get a warning "You are in a detached head state"

git checkout commmitID
