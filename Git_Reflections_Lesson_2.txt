 
Lesson 2:  creating a repsoistory

to start a new Git repository need to either clone or run:
git init

another command: git status will give you status of git. 

first you do "git init"
second you run "git add fileName"
Add is kind of a middle work area before it is committed

then you run "git commit"
This will commit all changes.  It will pull up your text editor and you will be able to enter your commit message.  
Alternatively you can run "git commit -m <msg>" directly from the command line.  This will add your message directly.  You can use multiple -m and it will concatenate them in messages.
