git remote command: 
git remote will show you what remote respositories are connected to your git directory.
You can also add a remote repository with the command:
git remote add "remoteBranch" "remoteLocation"  
for example: git remote add origin https://github.com/psuboy/gitReflections.git
Note that normally remote is called origin.

Git push command.  
to push your changes to a remote git server (www.github.com) you can use the push command.  
git push "remoteBranch"  "localBranch" 
example: git push origin master

Forks vs Clones vs Branches  What's the difference.

A fork is a GitHub think only.  If you want to copy somone's repository and make sure they still get credit use fork directly on GitHub.  It automatically copies it and give credit to the original author as the source.

A Clone is complete copy of an existing repository you can do it either directly from a git server such as git hub or you can do it from a local folder

A branch is a deviation off your existing code. 

Fetch Merge and Pull
If you get a change in your remote copy and a different change in your local copy it is not clear how to resolve.  
One way is to run the command: git fetch "remote"  (git fetch origin in our case) 
this will pull changes from your remote copy (origin) and copy them to your remote/branch  (origin/master) in our case.
Then you can merge the two in our case the command was git merge master origin/master  
This may result in a conflict if you changed some of the same lines.  just clean it up on the file.  add the file back in and commit it again.  You can then push that to your remote by usig git push origin.
